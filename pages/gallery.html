              Monstera deliciosa, also known as the split-leaf philodendron or Swiss cheese plant, 
              is a tropical plant often kept as a houseplant. This easy-to-grow climbing evergreen 
              provides a dramatic focal point due to its size and unique shape. Monstera deliciosa 
              has glossy, heart-shaped split leaves and is relatively easy to care for. It is a fast grower, 
              about 1 to 2 feet a year, and takes about three years to reach full-grown maturity.

              Orchids are beautiful indoor plants. They make wonderful plants for decorating the home. 
              The flowers are colorful, unique, and long-lasting. They have a reputation of being difficult 
              to grow indoors, but by selecting certain species and providing the proper environmental 
              conditions, success is almost guaranteed.

            <p>
              Snake plants are one of the most popular houseplants, for good reason. It's incredibly 
              drought-tolerant, able to go weeks without water in low and medium lighting conditions. 
              They tolerate low light (hence why they're so often seen in office buildings) but will 
              thrive in bright light, sending up new leaves and stronger variegation.

        <h2>Fiddle Leaf Fig</h2>

            <p>
              Fiddle leaf fig (Ficus lyrata) sometimes gets a finicky reputation. It's not the easiest 
              houseplant to grow, but its lovely large leaves and tree form make it worth a little effort 
              and a good choice even for the beginning gardener. These small trees are well adapted to indoor 
              temperatures and filtered light and are hardy enough to survive less-than-ideal conditions.
