          Monstera deliciosa, also known as the split-leaf philodendron or Swiss cheese plant, 
          is a tropical plant often kept as a houseplant. This easy-to-grow climbing evergreen 
          provides a dramatic focal point due to its size and unique shape. Monstera deliciosa 
          has glossy, heart-shaped split leaves and is relatively easy to care for. It is a fast grower, 
          about 1 to 2 feet a year, and takes about three years to reach full-grown maturity.

        <h2>Snake Plant</h2>
        <img src="https://www.myjunglehome.com.au/cdn/shop/products/sansevieria-laurentii-snake-plant-25cm-pot-my-jungle-home-160415_900x.jpg?v=1632920069"  width="400" alt="Snake plant with tall, pointy leaves edged in yellow."/>
        <p>
          Snake plants are one of the most popular houseplants, for good reason. It's incredibly 
          drought-tolerant, able to go weeks without water in low and medium lighting conditions. 
          They tolerate low light (hence why they're so often seen in office buildings) but will 
          thrive in bright light, sending up new leaves and stronger variegation.

        <h2>Fiddle Leaf Fig</h2>
        <img src="https://dy1yydbfzm05w.cloudfront.net/media/catalog/product/cache/466bc07fdd9f3406dd5cbfa6621097e2/f/i/fiddle-leaf_fig_plant_1.jpg"  width="400" alt="Tall Fiddle Leaf Fig plant in a modern white pot"/>
        <p>
          Fiddle leaf fig (Ficus lyrata) sometimes gets a finicky reputation. It's not the easiest 
          houseplant to grow, but its lovely large leaves and tree form make it worth a little effort 
          and a good choice even for the beginning gardener. These small trees are well adapted to indoor 
          temperatures and filtered light and are hardy enough to survive less-than-ideal conditions.
