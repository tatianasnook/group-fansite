      <h3>Light ðŸŒž</h3>
      <p>
        Different plants thrive under different amounts of light so it's important to know how much your specific plant needs. Most indoor plants prefer indirect light.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Shade/Low light:</b> Very little natural light; far from light sources
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Low Indirect Light:</b>  Light that's filtered or reflected; a dim room with a north-facing window or a spot far from a window
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Bright Indirect Light aka "Medium Light":</b> A bright light source, but not in the direct path of the sun. Most common for house plants!
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Partial Sun:</b>  Direct sun, but not intense "peak" sun heat/light
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Full Sun:</b> Direct, unfiltered sun for several hours a day.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <h3>WateringðŸ’¦</h3>
      <p>
        Identify your specific plant's watering needs. A rule of (green) thumb is that if the top inch of soil is dry, it's time to water!
        Make sure your plants have proper drainage holes or else standing water can lead to root rot

      <h3>Soil and Potting</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Use the Right Soil:</b> Most houseplants do well in a general-purpose potting mix. However, some plants like succulents or cacti need a fast-draining soil mix to prevent root rot.
        <br>
        <b>Repot when needed:</b> When a plant outgrows its pot (you may see roots poking out of the drainage holes), itâ€™s time to repot. Choose a pot about 1-2 inches wider than the current one.

    <section id="Temperature">
      <h3>Temperature and Humidity</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Ideal Temperature Range:</b> Most houseplants thrive in temperatures between 65-75Â°F (18-24Â°C). Avoid placing them near heaters, air conditioners, or drafty windows.
        <br>
        <b>Humidity Help:</b> Many plants, especially tropical varieties, love humidity. Misting, using a humidifier, or grouping plants together can help maintain a higher humidity level.

      <h3>Troubleshooting common issues</h3>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Yellowing Leaves: Often a sign of overwatering, nutrient deficiency, or low light.
          </li>
          <li>
            Drooping Leaves: This can indicate underwatering or a lack of humidity
          </li>
          <li>
            Brown Leaf Tips: Low humidity or too much direct sun might be the cause
          </li>
            
        </ul>

      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Fertilize During Growing Seasons: Most plants benefit from a bit of plant food during the spring and summer. Use a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer once a month during this time
          </li>
          <li>
            Skip Fertilizer in Fall and Winter: During cooler months, plants usually go dormant, so fertilizing isnâ€™t necessary.
          </li>
          <li>
            Regular Checkups: Look for signs of pests like tiny webs, holes in leaves, or sticky residue. Common pests include spider mites, aphids, and scale.
          </li>
          <li>
            Natural Remedies: If you spot pests, try spraying the plant with a mix of water and mild soap or using neem oil, which is a natural insecticide.
          </li>
            
        </ul>
